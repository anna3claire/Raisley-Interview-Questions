  <h2>Customer Success Engineer Application Questions <br> <i class="fas fa-question-circle"></i></h2>
<div class= "left-align">
<table>
     <p class="bold">Why would you be a good fit for the Customer Success Specialist role?</p>
      <p>I believe that technology is for everyone and as a Customer Success Specialist at Raisley, I would have the opportunity to help people embrace technology and grow their confidence in the tools. There's not much I enjoy more than the satisfaction of finding an answer to a difficult question. It's important to me that questions are not only answered, but answered well and to the satisfaction of everyone involved.  I would truly embrace the chance to work in this position and assist the customers of Raisley as they successfully navigate the products.</p>



      <p class="bold">Why do you want to work here over somewhere else?</p>
      <p>After researching Raisley, I found multiple reasons that I would prefer to work at Raisley over many other companies:</p>
      <p>1. The nature of Raisley's mission.  The idea of working for a company that is doing what it can to assist nonprofit organizations campaign for a better world is incredibly motivating. It allows an employee to take a certain pride in their work that they may not otherwise be able to do.</p>
      <p>
      2. The remote business model.  The ability to work abroad from many locations but still be connected is the epitome of working and living in the 21st century. I appreciate a company who is willing to embrace this and acknowledge that technology allows us to create a diverse and exceptional workforce across the globe.</p>



      <p class="bold">Which two tasks from our list are you are excited by, which do you want to learn and which two don’t you want to do? </p>
      <p>Honestly, everything on the list sounds interesting in its own right. If I had to choose the two I am most excited about, they would probably be: </p>
      <p>
      1.Plan new product features based on feedback from customers </p>
      <p>Listening to feedback and adjusting on the fly is a skill that I have learned as a program manager working with clients and as a teacher working with students in a classroom. I'm excited to continue to hone these skills in this field.</p>
      <p>
      2. Create a video tutorial on how to set up a campaign</p>
      <p>
      As a teacher, I have spent a lot of time explaining how things work or how to do a task so that students can most easily understand. I would love to take these skills and use it in more of a technical way through video tutorials and other mediums like this.</p>
      <p>
      The two I would like to learn:</p>
     <p>
      1. Work with developers to debug and resolve a product issue</p>
      <p>
      I would love to work with a team of developers and learn more about the process of debugging and resolving issues within the products.</p>
     <p>
      2. Running a training webinar</p>
      <p>
      I have facilitated numerous training workshops over the years. However, I have never run a training as a webinar. I would welcome the opportunity to learn and practice this style of training sessions.</p>
      <p>
      The two I don't want to do:</p>

      <p>It is probably cliché to say this, but there is actually nothing on the list I wouldn't like to do. There are certainly things that seem less glamorous, such as replying to 20 customer support emails.  However, I have often found that it is usually the least glamorous work that is the most effective and helpful to the clients. Therefore, it is impossible to disregard its importance and I would be very excited to help customers find success through the products by replying to any number of emails they may send.</p>



      <p class="bold">Tell us about a company who does customer support well, and why you think they’re good.</p>
      <p>Last year, I had a negative experience flying with Southwest Airlines. The plane had technical problems and got off the ground behind schedule.  Unfortunately, this meant that I missed my connecting flight and was forced to wait in the airport with a 12-hour layover because there were no available seats on any of the flights leaving earlier in the day. I had been heading home from a trip to visit family and was expected back at work the following day.</p>
      <p>However, my negative experience was quickly resolved thanks to the curteous and attentive service agents at Southwest. When I have had other flight delays, it hasn't been abnormal to find a less than understanding customer service agent or a toll free number that rings endlessly and eventually drops your call.  I was pleasantly surprised to find none of this with Southwest. From the wonderfully helpful agent in the airport, to the friendly phone representative, every customer service agent I came in contact with was ready and willing to do what they could to help me. Even if the individual agent wasn't able to do much to help, they appeared to do all they could and seemed genuinely regretful if they couldn't offer a lot in the end. This made all the difference and I have always remembered these interactions.  Sometimes it's not the final result that is most important, but that when there is a problem, someone is there to listen and do their best to help where they can.</p>
